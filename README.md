Open source technology/tool stack used: Java, Selenium WebDriver, BDD with Cucumber, Maven and PageFactory design, Git and Jenkins.
BDD along with PageFactory design patterns is the best approach followed by industries today. Feature files in BDD are the exact replica of the appâ€™s behaviour in the form of user stories. Everyone working in an agile environment is on the same page and hence direct usage of user story in the test framework saves a lot of time and makes it easy to understand for everyone. Moreover, it provides easy maintenance and scalability.
Following BDD approach, framework has been built in a way such that functionalities can be tested individually like unit tests as well in an end to end fashion (regression test).
In order to achieve Continuous Integration, Git has been used for source control, Maven for managing the build dependencies and it can be easily integrated with Jenkins for automatic scheduling and execution of test scripts.
